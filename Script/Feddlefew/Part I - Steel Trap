Part I: Steel Trap

[A MYSTERIOUS PERSON awakens tied to a chair in a dim room]
FRONTIERSMAN: Ah, Douglass Klein, my old nemesis, we meet at last. After all the years of thwartin my plans to expand Frontier World an Action Park, did ya think that that ridiculous disguise would hide your ugly mug?

FRONTIERSMAN: PAUL! UNMASK THE PRISONER!

[Player looses disguise!]

FRONTIERSMAN: Huh? Holy Horseshoes, your not Inspector Klein! Who are ya? Some kinda… Hamster Avenger?

Inspector Klein

LEMMING WOMAN: Who’s Inspector Klein?
FRONTIERSMAN: [Laughs] Ya hear that, Paul? Rodent girl here doesn’t know about Klein. He’s the worst! A pox on the face of wholesome family entertainment! Always tryin to shut me down. It’s a disgrace!

FRONTIERSMAN: Sure, I may have had to bend a few little health and safety laws to make ends meet. Ya know what’s wrong with kids these days? Always too busy playin with their gathern magic cards an pok-e-mans an YouPages. They just don’t want to get up off their lazy butts and go see some REAL entertainment.

FRONTIERSMAN: It’s not like anyone’s died from fallin off the narrow viewin platform above the Gopher Saloon and Terrarium. Why should I have to pay 40 bucks to put up guard rails when I can put in a new attraction, or get utilizin the latest and greatest in advertisin technology?

FRONTIERSMAN: Anyway, ya better hope Klein doesn’t show his ugly mug for awhile, ‘cause I only got enough room in this trap for one interloper.

LEMMING WOMAN: I’m not a hamster-themed hero! I’m-

FRONTIERSMAN: A mouse, then? Well, Ms. Mouse you wandered right into my trap, and I didn’t even set it for ya!

Trap

LEMMING WOMAN: I’ve been locked in supply closest before.

FRONTIERSMAN: But I betcha’ve never been locked in a supply closet with a state of the art MECHA PAUL BUNION! I figured I might as well let Paul here do the honors of finishing Klein off, on account of the good inspector decided to close down Paul Bunion’s Authentic Clear Cuttin and log Spitin show because of a few splinters.

LEMMING WOMAN: A tree branch is not a splinter.

FRONTIERSMAN: Details!

Safety

LEMMING WOMAN: It sounds like your park is a bit, uh, dangerous.

FRONTIERSMAN: So?

LEMMING WOMAN: “So?” Your park is a deathtrap! There’s a log flume running through an active saw mill, the hall of giant spherical objects is dangerously unsecured and full of ramps, and the gophers are able to freely leave their enclosure to rob banks and hold people for ransom! Have Are you trying to kill your customers?

FRONTIERSMAN: If they can’t leave, they can’t spend their money elsewhere. It’s just business sense little lady. The only hard part is getting a steady supply of new customers. But I’ve got some new ads going that are workin just fine on that front.

Advertising

LEMMING WOMAN: Let me guess, you’re the one behind the hypno ads that’ve been showing up around here.

FRONTIERSMAN: Don’t be stupid girl. Everyone knows hypnotism is bubkiss. All my ads do is plant subliminal messages in folk’s subconsciouses, makin them drop what they’re doin an bring their life savins down to Frontier World and Action Park for some good family entertainment.

FRONTIERSMAN: It can take a few viewins for em to work, but the billboards work every time, thanks to the little radio transmitters I stuck in ‘em. Once I launch a satalite over the U S of A, I’ll get people comin in from all over the country. Heck, I’ll probably get even get some Canadians. Once I get enough money, an dispose of that annoyin Inspector, I’ll finally be able to open up that miniature golf course my pa always talked about buildin.
